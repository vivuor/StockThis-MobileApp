# StockThis-MobileApp
This is my project for a course about React Native

I used React Native to make this application where you can find different stocks from many markets. I'm using Stockdata.org REST API for this.
I played around with some libraries other than React Natives own. I ended up using React Native Paper for some components.
I'm also using Firebases realtime database with this application. You can search stocks and add them to your portfolio. The stocks that you add to your portfolio
are saved to Firebase.
